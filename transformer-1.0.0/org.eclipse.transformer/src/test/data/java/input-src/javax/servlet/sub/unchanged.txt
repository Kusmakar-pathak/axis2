Unchanged text file.
Testing application of package renames to Java and JSP.
The rename is "javax.servlet" to "jakarta.servlet".
For example, "javax.servlet.Servlet" transforms to "jakarta.servlet.Servlet".
This file is an unselected text file and should be unchanged.
However, the rename rule should still apply.
